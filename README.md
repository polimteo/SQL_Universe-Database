This project is about building a database of celestial bodies using PostgreSQL.

Throughout this project, I have accomplished the following tasks:

1. Created a database named "universe".

3. Created 6 tables within the "universe" database, namely:
    - black_hole
    - constellation
    - galaxy
    - moon
    - planet
    - star

3. Set a primary key for each table, ensuring that each primary key automatically increment.
